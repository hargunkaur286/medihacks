        Your Baby Is:
        A hope, a wish, a gleam in your eye.
        Also does not actually technically exist yet.
        
        You Are:
        Taking prenatal vitamins just in case.
        Drinking all the wine in the house so it won’t go to waste.
        Completely unaware that this is The Month.
  
        Due to the craziness that is Pregnancy Math, by the time you actually conceive, you are already two whole weeks pregnant. So…congratulations! Only 38 more weeks to go. You’re doing GREAT!
  
        While some of us are obsessive lucky enough to know our child’s conception date down to the minute, more often it’s a tricky thing to know for sure. Did you ovulate early or late? Was it that time on the couch or that night you both couldn’t sleep? In a few weeks an ultrasound will be able to give you a better idea of your embryo’s age, but it won’t change the countdown. The medical establishment prefers to shrug its shoulders and say, “Eff this, when did your last period start? Okay, so…that was Pregnancy Day One. Don’t argue.”
  
        You might be charting, taking your temperature, peeing on ovulation predictor sticks, examining mucus. You might be holding your partner’s hand during an embryo transfer at the fertility clinic. You might just be kind of hoping, or going about things the old-fashioned way: passionate unprotected sex with a strapping young cabana boy named Marco. (Or passionate unprotected sex with your husband or boyfriend, whom I suppose could also be named Marco.)
  
        No matter which way you go about it, I can tell you this: the best stuff is yet to come.

        Your baby is:
        A rogue band of cells, a’huntin’ and a’feudin’ and rapidly dividin’ while traveling the wilds of your fallopian tube, headed towards the uterine promised land.
        About the size of the head of a pin.
        Possibly already the cutest thing you’ve ever seen.
        
        You are:
        Still pretty clueless.
        Welcome to the two-week wait! This is the mind-numbingly annoying stretch of days between ovulation and peestick time.
  
        Let’s just get the nonsense out of the way: Exercising won’t knock the baby loose. Drinking a margarita (or hell, plural margaritas) before you know you’re pregnant won’t make your baby’s brain grow inside out. Sleeping on your side/back/stomach won’t cause/prevent a miscarriage/ectopic pregnancy/a baby with flippers.
  
        The human race? We are actually a fairly hardy bunch. We existed for many many years without early result pregnancy tests and six-week ultrasounds and Folic Acid supplements. Obviously, stuff happens — and many times that stuff gets dealt with very early on in life in the form of a spontaneous miscarriage, but there’s very little YOU can do at this point to sway the outcome. So pop a prenatal vitamin, take a swig of whatever beverage you damn well feel like swigging, cross your fingers and hope for the best.
  
        And this goes for anyone who already knows they’re pregnant and is now scouring through the earlier weeks in a panic because of “something” they did wrong before they knew. That hour in the hot tub…that fall on the icy sidewalk… the vodka shooters at your friend’s bachelorette party. Did I hurt my baby?
  
        I was right up there with the Best of the Neurotics during my first pregnancy. Every twinge and cramp meant hours of worry and fretting. I checked the toilet paper for blood every time I went to the bathroom. A fall down some stairs at a restaurant brought me to hysterical tears and sent me to bed for the rest of the day. And you know what? It didn’t change anything, except that all my memories of early pregnancy are colored with a lot of stress and fear. I went on to give birth to an honest-to-God tank of a baby, and to wish that someone had just slapped me early on and told me to CHILL OUT.
  
        So my goal for this pregnancy is to do just that: CHILL OUT. And to remember that not everything is within my control, that Every Bad Thing cannot be avoided by obsessing over fruits and vegetables and low-mercury fish alone, and that expecting the worst does not make The Worst hurt any less if it happens. So…deep breath…enjoy it, Self. (As much as you can enjoy something that makes you so gassy and tired and bloated.)
  
        And for any pregnant woman joining me along the way over the next 30-odd weeks or so, hopefully I will be the written-word equivalent of that slap in the face. You chill out too! That’s an order! Look at how chilled out I am! Eeeeeeeee!

        Your baby is:
        * Implanted snugly in the rich lining of your delicious uterus.
        * Still less than a millimeter long.
        * Seriously, a MILLIMETER. Go pull out a ruler and wrap your mind around that.
        * I will wait.
        * Okay, that little millimeter is growing three different cell layers already — the ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm.
        * In case you FOR SOME REASON don’t remember high school biology class (shame!), those are the earliest beginning of your baby’s nervous system, hair, skin, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, thyroid, skeleton, blood system, connective tissue, urogenital system and muscles. Oh, IS THAT ALL?
        
        You are:
        * Probably wondering where your period is.
        * Beating the hell out of your boobs to see if they’re sore.
        * Peeing on sticks, possibly cursing out sticks.
  
        Sometime around the end of week four, you will officially miss your period, if you’re the sort of gal who pays attention to that sort of thing. 
  
        The Earliest Signs Of Pregnancy.
  
        For a lot of women, sore boobs are the first sign that Something Is Up. But sore boobs are also a pretty common symptom of regular ol’ PMS. So…argh! Useless! A lot of women (myself included) report that pregnant sore boobs ARE different than PMS sore boobs, but in a way that’s hard to describe. Mine are more…burny and stabby and heavy, whereas PMS boobs just kind of…ache. Wearing a bra hurts, going without a bra hurts. Wrapping a towel around your chest after a shower hurts. That moment when you take your bra off at the end of the day hurrrrrrrts, like YOW YOW YOW THAT HURTS. Except when it doesn’t hurt, because the soreness can and does vary from day to day. (So if you’re pregnant and your boobs hurt yesterday but don’t hurt today, don’t panic, and don’t mash them into lumpy potatoes while trying to get reassurance that you’re still pregnant.)
  
        Personally, I like to shake things up a little bit and get the morning sickness going as soon as humanly possible. The books say most women get nauseous around week six or seven. (Those women who aren’t among the lucky 25% who never suffer from it at all.) (I HATE YOU.) My gastrointestinal tract is the first thing to go all kablooey in pregnancy, with dry heaving, sensitivity to odors, acid reflux, constipation and bloating to the point of needing maternity clothes showing up right away. (I am wicked sexy.) I’ve managed to steer clear of actual puking so far, but we’ll see what happens around week seven, when my general digestive discomfort turned into full-on vomitous misery in Pregnancy #1. (I really do think I had a 24-hour stomach bug the week before I tested, but the pregnancy hormones kept everything churning for a few extra days.)
  
        All my research sources mention “implantation bleeding” as an early sign of pregnancy. This would happen sometime between the end of week three and the beginning of week four and result in a light and one-time spotting on your underwear. Nobody I know has ever reported this actually happening to them, but dozens of women I know have tried to convince themselves that no, that’s NOT their period starting, that’s implantation bleeding, I better pee on a stick! (Full disclosure: I may be including my own dumb hopeful self here.)
  
        And then there’s the fatigue, the headaches and backaches and uterine cramping and changes in appetite and the frequent dashes to the bathroom to pee. All this and those pesky peesticks may STILL be giving you the Big Fat Negative.

        Your baby:
        * Is about the size of a sesame seed.
        * Looks more like a tadpole than a human-variety baby.
        * Making developmental leaps and bounds by the hour like a damned GENIUS CHILD.
        
        You:
        * Are totally for-real pregnant, with a positive home pregnancy test to prove it and everything.
        * Are definitely popping a prenatal vitamin everyday — you can pick them up at any grocery store or vitamin shop. Your doctor can also write you a prescription, but if your insurance doesn’t cover them it’s perfectly fine to buy them off the shelf.
        * If you don’t FEEL very pregnant yet, don’t panic. It’s early. Breast tenderness and fatigue may be all you’ve got at this point.
        * Oh, and yes, it is time to stop smoking, drinking, doing drugs and licking inner-city mailboxes, if you’re into that sort of thing.
  
        Operation Chill Out hit its first major obstacle this week in the form of cramping. Lots and lots of cramping.

      week: 6,
      title: "Week 6",
      content: `
        Your baby:
        * Has tripled or even quadrupled in size and is now three or four entire millimeters long! Godzilla baby!
        * Is working on growing a nose, some ears and a mouth.
        * Is also growing flappy little leg and arm buds.
        * Has a heartbeat that can be seen on an ultrasound — 100 to 160 beats per minute.
        
        You:
        * Are maybe moody as hell.
        * Are getting up in the middle of the night to pee.
        * Food cravings and/or aversions can be pretty strong at this point. If salad with a prenatal vitamin chaser makes your stomach flip and your esophagus burn, then for God’s sake skip the salad and eat something that sounds appealing, be it chicken nuggets or black olives straight out of the can. There’s no need to be the Healthy Salad Martyr Pregnant Woman, nobody likes her anyway.
        * Depending on the state of your digestive system and appetite, you may have gained a couple pounds already — or you may have lost weight. Don’t stress either way right now. It’ll probably all even out in the end.
  
        If you are “lucky” enough to score an ultrasound this week, you’ll probably be able to see your baby’s heartbeat. It’s ridiculously exciting, considering it mostly looks like some flickering pixels on a TV with really crappy reception. After seeing the heartbeat, your risk of miscarriage shoots down to 10 to 15%. It’s not as great as getting out of the double-digits (at 10 weeks your risk is only 3%), but still. In the crapshoot of fertility, take the sighs of relief whenever you can get them.
  
        I saw my own little Quasimobryo’s heartbeat on Monday, and pumped my fists in the air and told my husband to get my toddler’s giant melon head out of the way of the screen. My doctor attempted to get a better idea of the baby’s gestational age by measuring the head-to-rump length (which in these early days is more like “head-like-bulge-to-tail-like-tadpole-bottom), but came up with a measurement of only 5 weeks, 6 days.
        I’ve decided to go ahead and ignore this age, because 1) it would be very, VERY unlikely to see a strong, obvious heartbeat at that age, 2) ultrasound measurements are very, VERY unreliable, particularly early on, and 3) I don’t want to believe I am going to be pregnant for that many more weeks.
  
        So I’m sticking with my earlier hunch that I am six full weeks along and closing in on week seven. Take THAT, science! You can’t make me believe things I don’t want to believe!
        And for those of you who are not me, and therefore probably aren’t nearly as interested in my Gestational Age of Mystery, may I just encourage y’all to take it easy? During my first pregnancy, I actually tried to fight my symptoms. No naps! Naps are for the weak! No junk food even though oh my God it would taste so good and be the edible equivalent to getting someone to scratch that one itch right in the middle of your back where you can’t reach…oh…ahhh. No! You eat salad and healthy grilled chicken! (Even though: chicken! Ew! Puke!) No Tylenol no matter how much your head hurts! Sack up, little camper!
  
        Try to rest. You aren’t lazy or out of shape — you’re pregnant and there’s just no fighting this fatigue. Try to eat what will stay down with the least amount of discomfort. Pay attention to your fiber intake (trust me, you don’t want to add hemorrhoids to your first-trimester woes) and don’t freak out if you had a tad less Folic Acid today than yesterday. Extra orange juice is a noble idea, but not if it’s causing you fetal-position-type heartburn. I remember trying to act specifically NOT pregnant at work during the first trimester, but there definitely comes a time to cry uncle, eat the box of powdered donuts and then ask your boss if you can leave an hour early so you can go home and take a nap.
